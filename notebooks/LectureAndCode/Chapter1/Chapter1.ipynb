    "### Modules and imports\n",
    "\n",
    "A Python program is constructed from code blocks. A *block* is a piece of Python program text that is executed as a unit. The following are blocks: a module, a function body, and a class definition. Each command typed interactively is a block.  A script file (a file given as standard input to the interpreter or specified as a command line argument to the interpreter) is a code block.  A script command (a command specified on the interpreter command line with the [`-c`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-c) option) is a code block. A module run as a top level script (as module `__main__`) from the command line using a [`-m`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-m) argument is also a code block.\n",
    "\n",
    "Module is Python's basic structural (abstraction / grouping) unit. The file name is the module name with the suffix `.py` appended.  Within a module, the moduleâ€™s name (as a string) is available as the value of the global variable `__name__`. A module can contain executable statements as well as function definitions. It acts kind of like a namespace (C++) and everything from one module can be imported to another module. If python modules are placed into tree-like directory structure they are considered packages (Java) or simply nested namespaces (C++). In order that to happen however, each directory must contain a special `__init__.py` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "A module can be imported in following ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Very bad**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[...]\n",
    "from mymodule import *\n",
    "[...]\n",
    "x = sqrt(4)  # Is sqrt part of mymodule? A builtin? Defined above?\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Imports `mymodule`, and creates references to all public objects defined by that module in the current namespace (everything listed in `__all__` if `__all__` exists, otherwise everything that doesn't start with `_`). Does not set the variable `foo`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Better**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from mymodule import sqrt\n",
    "[...]\n",
    "x = sqrt(4)  # sqrt may be part of mymodule, if not redefined in between\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Imports `mymodule`, and creates references to all the members listed (`sqrt`). Does not set the variable `mymodule`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import mymodule\n",
    "[...]\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Imports `mymodule`, and creates a reference to that module in the  current namespace. Then you need to define completed module path to  access a particular attribute or method from inside the module.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a module is imported, the interpreter first searches for a built-in module with that name. If not found, it then searches for a file named `*.py` in a list of directories given by the variable [`sys.path`](https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/sys.html#sys.path).  [`sys.path`](https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/sys.html#sys.path) is initialized from these locations:\n",

    "\n",
    "Up until the Python 3.3 there has been only 1 type of package, a regular package. Later there has been added an implicit namespace package type. Regular package is simply a directory with an `__init__.py` file. If a directory contains this file it is only considered a regular package and nothing more. However if a directory is left without the `__init__.py` it will implicitly be considered as a namespace. If there are more directories with the same name in different parts of the Python-path (different locations) they will all constitute one single namespace.

    "* Perform pre-importing / aliases - define the API\n",
